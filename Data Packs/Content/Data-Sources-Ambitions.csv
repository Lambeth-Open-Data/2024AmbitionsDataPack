1,,Health and Wellbeing introduction,,,,,,,,,health-and-wellbeing-introduction,#health-and-wellbeing-introduction,"The Health and Wellbeing section of State of the Borough report summarises the health of people living Lambeth by bringing together Office for Health Improvement and Dipartites (OHID) data and knowledge with information from other sources to give a broad picture of the health of people in Lambeth today.

Starting Well
Setting the foundations for health and wellbeing during pregnancy and in the early years is crucial to ensure we give every child the very best start in life as possible as what happens in pregnancy and early childhood impacts on physical and emotional health all the way through to adulthood. Several outcomes are described in this section:

•	Childhood vaccinations, MMR dose 1 at age 2 years old
•	Healthy weight at reception
•	Good level of development at end of reception
•	Healthy weight a year 6

Living well
Living well is essential in helping us manage our health and maintain our independence.  Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, such as smoking or drinking alcohol, determine the burden of disease and illness within a population. Many of the risk factors associated with poor health are avoidable and can be prevented in some way by adopting healthy lifestyles. Several outcomes are described in this section:

•	Wellbeing
•	Sexual health
•	Substance misuse
•	Physical exercise
•	Healthy weight
•	Smoking
•	High blood pressure
•	Long term conditions

Aging well
Over the next 10 years the number of people aged over 50 will grow by 50%. The public health agenda aims to improve the health of our population to enable more years spent in good health. Several outcomes are described in this section:

•	Life expectancy at birth
•	Healthy life expectancy
•	Deaths under 75, preventable cause
•	Preventable mortality – Covid-19
•	Preventable mortality – Cancer
•	Preventable mortality – Cardiovascular disease
•	Preventable mortality – Liver Disease
•	Preventable mortality – Respiratory disease

Education

A household is classified as deprived in the education dimension if no one has at least level 2 education and no one aged 16 to 18 years is a full-time student.

Employment 

A household is classified as deprived in the employment dimension if any member, not a full-time student, is either unemployed or economically inactive due to long-term sickness or disability.

Health

A household is classified as deprived in the health dimension if any person in the household has general health that is bad or very bad or is identified as disabled.

People who have assessed their day-to-day activities as limited by long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses are considered disabled.  This definition of a disabled person meets the harmonised standard for measuring disability and is in line with the Equality Act (2010).

Housing

A household is classified as deprived in the housing dimension if the household's accommodation is either overcrowded, in a shared dwelling, or has no central heating.""
